# Text-Recognition
Recognize the text in an image using Python 

Note: Before executing this program make shure that this program and the image file are in the same folder/ directory

To run this python program you have to download and install
    #cv2
    #pytesseract

Then in line 4 add the '.exe' path of tesseract

In line 6 give the name of the image file

In line 20 give any name for the text file

Tha's pretty much it. It can recoganize any text from any proper image.

Final note: If you face errors while execution, you should solve it by your own. Debugging/Rectifying an error in a code is part a of programming.
