# Text-Recognition
Recognize the text in an image using Python 

Note: Before executing this program make sure that this program and the image file are in the same folder/directory

To run this python program you have to download and install
    #cv2 - pip install cv2
    #pytesseract - pip install pytesseract, also you have find the github repo for the tesseract and install the '.exe' file

Then in line 4 add the '.exe' path of tesseract.*The '.exe' file that I've mentioned here is not the app you download from github but the file from the pip scripts. You find the location and add it to the path*

In line 6 give the name of the image file

In line 20 give any name for the text file

Tha's pretty much it. It can recoganize any text from any proper image.

Final note: If you face errors while executing the program, you should solve it by your own. Debugging/Rectifying an error in a code is a part of programming.

*This program was actually taken from geeksforgeeks for educational purpose. The original contributer was AnandhJagadeesan whome I have never even met. We hope that he didn't sue us for copying his work.*
